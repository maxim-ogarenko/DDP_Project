## An attempt to write my own Business Intelligence system 

Many small businesses cannot afford the full-scale business intelligence systems, and struggle with obtaining even simple analytical information.

I tried to write a prototype of a simple BI system using some actual sales data at my hand. 

This app visualizes sales of a chain of **three shops** for the period **from 2017-04-11 to 2019-08-01**. 

## User interface  

The user can choose:  

- **dates range** 
- **shops** to analyze (sorry, the shop names are Cyrillic).


## Output

The app builds an **interactive graph** with **monthly sales** of the chosen shops in the chosen time period. 

The sales are in **Russian Rubles**.
